# JavaScript 2020 Salary Tool
## A theoretical salary calculator
#### Derived from The State Of JS 2019 downloadable data using Machine Learning and Tensorflow.js

[Live Demo](https://camsjams.github.io/state-of-js-salary/)

## Install
>       $ npm install

## Local Dev
>       $ npm run dev

## Build
>       $ npm run build

This calculator is not associated with the State of JavaScript organizers or team, and is purely for demonstration purposes.

The salary displayed above is derived from about 20,000 real answers from the 2019 State of JavaScript survey. That being said, sample size, regional difference, survey bias, local cost of living, gender, race, and other factors contributing to an engineer's salary will create a large margin of error.
